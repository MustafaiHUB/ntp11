              The national technology parade (NTP) is an annual event held at
              one of the Jordanian universities in collaboration with Queen
              Rania Center for Entrepreneurship (QRCE). This event aims at
              motivating the innovative thinking among Jordanian undergraduate
              students and at unlocking their potentials. It also aims at
              directing the efforts of students and faculty toward exploiting
              technology to solve local problems at the national level, and at
              building an integration and effective cooperation between industry
              and academia. The eighth NTP will be held in The University of
              Jordan on April 29, 2015. The 8th NTP comes with more focus on the
              role of technology in improving the quality of life. This
              improvement is sought in several areas including sustainable
              living, public safety, childcare, healthcare, service automation
              and e-services, entertainment, and others.
